# DS Intermediate Level Class

Welcome to the intermediate-level DS class, where we will learn about the core skills for a good Data Scientist and how to use these skills in interviews and projects. Hope you'll enjoy the class and learn something from it.

## Prerequisites
To make sure you can participate in the class and maximize your learning experience, we assume you're already reasonably familiar with the following:

- basic python programming using either notebook or IDE
- basic understanding of data structure
- exploratory data analysis using popular python packages (e.g. `pandas matplotlib seaborn`)
- git and using GitHub - we will be using GitHub for homework submission and collaboration

If you're not familiar with the topics above, please feel free to check out our [repo for intro class](https://github.com/DS-XL/ds-intro-class-2022) or consult your OneCareer coach on how to access/learn intro class material to get up to speed.

## Expectations
We are here to teach the class materials during class, and guide your self-paced study out of class (readings, homework, Capstone project). If you're enrolled in this class, we expect you to try your best to do the following: 

- attend livestream classess and actively participate in the class
- watch recorded classes before the next homework and Q&A discussion class
- read provided reading materials and watch recommended videos
- complete and submit homework on time
- follow instructions and requirements for homework and Capstone project
- provide feedback to teachers when needed

We will try out best to provide feedback on your homework and project if they are *submitted on time following instructions*. 

## Topics
Here is a list of topics we will cover in intermediate level class

### 1. Statistic Basics For ML
We will give you a quick refresher on key statistics concepts and the bare basics of stats you might come across as a data scientist.
 
### 2. Supervised learning: statistical models
We will introduce the most "basic" but important tranditional statistical models: linear models and generalized linear models (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression). 

### 3. Supervised learning: tree-based Models
We will also cover the non-parametric, more machine-learning flavored tree-based models:

- decision tree
- concept of bagging and random forest
- concept of boosting and gradient boosting machine

### 4. Unsupervised learning Methods
We will cover what is unsupervised learning, and discuss use cases and examples of using unsupervised learning including:

* Clustering - K-means, DBSCAN
* Dimensionality reduction - PCA, Matrix Factorization

### 5. Feature Engineering and Model Interpretation
We will cover these "secret weapons" in modeling that could help you stand out in technical skills and stakeholder communication.

Feature Engineering:

- Data Handling
- Numerical transformation
- Categorical to Numerical (grouping/encoding/transformation)
- Features creation and data aggregation

Model interpretation:

- Interpretable Models
- Tools to make the Black Box models more transparent

### 6. Capstone project
We designed a mock take-home project focused on modeling as our class Capstone project. We will be releasing the dataset and requirement halfway through the program and you will have at least 4 weeks to work on it. We will grade the modeling results and reports, and have a group discussion at the very end. 

**Bonus**: Students that does the best in Capstone project can choose a free consultation session (up to 1 hour) with the teachers to discuss resume, projects, or general job hunting/career caoch questions.
