# Topic 1 homework

### Exercise 1
Use the data `state.csv` to do the following exercise:

Read the data in pandas, and perform exploratory data analysis for all variables in the data:

1. Show all data types, missing rates
2. Numerical variables provide mean, standard deviation, five number summary, histogram
3. Categorical variables provide a frequency table and bar chart
4. Perform at least 2 pairs of variables for 2 types of bivariate charts
5. Provide a short summary to describe what you know about your data in this exercise.

### Exercise 2
Use the data `loans_income.csv` to do the following exercise:

Read the data in pandas and:

1. Draw a sample with 1000 observations. Plot the sample's data distribution
2. Implement bootstrap to take 10, 50, 100, and 1000 times resampling to repeatedly draw an income sample with 10 incomes. Plot the sample mean distribution for each resampling 
3. Implement bootstrap to take 10, 50, 100, and 1000 times resampling to repeatedly draw an income sample with 100 incomes. Plot the sample mean distribution for each resampling 
4. Overlap distribution plots of samples in 2 and 3 when the resampling size is the same.

### Exercise 3
A rental car company claims the average time to rent a car on its website is 60 seconds with a standard deviation of 30 seconds. A random sample of 36 customers attempted to rent a car on the website. 

1. If the average time to rent was 65 seconds. Is this enough evidence to contradict the company's claim at a 5% significance level? What's the power?

2. If the analytics team believes the previous claim is incorrect and the average time to rent is 67 seconds, what is the sample size needed to design a sufficient test with 85% of power to test this new claim?
